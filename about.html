        I’m just your average person with a passion for learning, design, and functionality.
        Not too long ago I started my journey to become a Web Developer and began 
        putting together a path to follow, cramming my head full of knowledge every 
        day and practicing until I was sure I could do it in my sleep (or at least after a quick google search).
        After wrapping my mind around the world of code, building several apps connecting databases,
        and slowly (painfully slowly) getting better at an eye 
        for design I was drawn to watch faces. Imagine my surprise when the coding I 
        have learned applied directly to making digital watch faces. Not only did making 
        a few watch faces help with my designing. It was a baby step tword bigger 
        things. With a very finite screen size I was able to focus on every little detail and 
        position each design until it was exactly as I imagined in my head and I hope you 
        enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them. If you have a face in mind and can’t 
        find it no matter how high or low you look, contact me and I’ll try my best to make 
        your vision for free.
